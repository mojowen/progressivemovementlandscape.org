        <h4>What is this site?</h4>
        <p>ProgressiveMovementLandscape.org is a publicly available website where people can access a list of progressive and/or resistance organizations via an AirTable database.</p>

        <p>The list was made publicly available to help interested parties map the organizations, leaders, and capacity of the progressive movement coast-to-coast.</p>
        <p>The list is a living, ever-changing document maintained by volunteers. Individuals and organizations are encouraged to submit corrections, additions, and subtractions in an effort to maintain accuracy.</p>
        <p>The public data set is sortable, filterable, and downloadable for anyone’s use.</p>

        <p>We encourage you to contact us with feedback if you have suggested changes to the output or bulk data to input.</p>

        <h4>Who put this together? Why?</h4>
        <p>Following the 2016 election, there were many individuals and organizations compiling lists of new and existing organizations working on behalf of progressive causes. In an effort to reduce the burden on groups to maintain a separate database of basic, publicly available information about these organizations, a small group of volunteers decided to join forces, combine lists, and make the information available to everyone on a public site.</p>

        <p>The core list was built with the help of many people and organizations, compiled primarily by GameChangers (a ##), Reboot Democracy (a pro-democracy technology incubator), and Impactual (a DC-based social impact strategy firm).</p>

        <p>The site was developed by Impactual and the data is being managed by a team of moderators including Emily Baum (Reboot Democracy), Erica Sagrans (GameChangers), Matt Singer (Movement 2017), Ashley Spillane (Impactual), and Billy Wimsatt (GameChangers).</p>

        <h4>Who can access the data on the site?</h4>
        <p>Anyone! That’s why we put all of the data we have collectively assembled in the AirTable on the public-facing website. We not only welcome, but encourage you to download it or use AirTable’s API to use the data for your own purposes!</p>

        <h4>What if I want access to the AirTable?</h4>
        <p>Anyone building a tool who would like to contribute to the data set more directly will be given access upon signing a standard user agreement.</p>

        <p>Because the AirTable is the direct source for the forward-facing website (and any changes in the AirTable will be reflected on the website), the AirTable is managed by a set of volunteer moderators who are responsive to community needs. If you think you need access for your project, <a href="/#contact">contact us now</a>.</p>

        <h4>What happens if I am approved to access the AirTable?</h4>
        <p>If you’re approved for temporary access, you’ll have to sign our user agreement. We’ll share it when you’re approved.</p>
